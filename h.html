            Hufflepuff valued hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.[4] Its emblematic animal was the
            badger,[3][3] it's representative gemstone was yellow diamonds, and yellow and black were its colours.[2]
            Pomona Sprout was the Head of Hufflepuff during 1991â€“1998,[6] Sprout left the post of Head of Hufflepuff and
            Herbology Professor sometime before 2017 and her successor for the position of Head of Hufflepuff was
            currently unknown. The Fat Friar was its ghost.[4] The founder of the House was Helga Hufflepuff.[1]

            Hufflepuff corresponded to the element of earth.[2] The Hufflepuff dormitories and common room were located
            somewhere in the basement, near the castle's kitchens. It could be accessed by tapping the barrel two from
            the bottom, middle of the second row in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff" and was described as being a cosy
            and welcoming place with yellow hangings, fat armchairs, and underground tunnels that led to the
            dormitories, which had perfectly round doors, similar to barrel tops.[9] Famous Hufflepuffs included Hengist
            of Woodcroft (founder of Hogsmeade), Newt Scamander (author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and
            Artemisia Lufkin (first female Minister for Magic). The significant object of Hufflepuff was Helga
            Hufflepuff's Cup, which was [turned into a Horcrux by Tom Riddle.
