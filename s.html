            Slytherin valued ambition, leadership, self-preservation, cunning and resourcefulness[4] and was founded by
            Salazar Slytherin.[1] Its emblematic animal was the serpent,[3][3] it's representative gemstone was
            emeralds, and its colours were emerald green and silver.[2] Professor Horace Slughorn was the Head of
            Slytherin during the 1997â€“1998 school year, replacing Severus Snape, who as well replaced Slughorn as
            Potions Professor when he retired for the first time several years prior.[8][7] Slytherin had produced the
            most Death Eaters and Dark Wizards,[24][35][36] including Tom Riddle,[27] Bellatrix Lestrange and Lucius
            Malfoy, for example. But that does not mean that other Houses hadn't produced any; Peter Pettigrew was a
            Gryffindor, and Quirinus Quirrell was a Ravenclaw.
