            Ravenclaw valued intelligence, knowledge, curiosity, creativity and wit.[4] Its emblematic animal was the
            eagle,[3][3] it's representative gemstone was sapphires, and its colours were blue and bronze[2]. The
            Ravenclaw Head of House in the 1990s was Filius Flitwick.[7] The ghost of Ravenclaw was the Grey Lady,[4]
            who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the House's founder.[34] Ravenclaw corresponded to the element of
            air.[2] The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories were located in a tower on the west side of the castle.
            Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories.[10] This
            riddle, however, could be answered by non-Ravenclaws.[29] Famous Ravenclaws included Luna Lovegood, Gilderoy
            Lockhart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander. The significant object of
            Ravenclaw was Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem, which was turned into a Horcrux by Tom Riddle.[34]
